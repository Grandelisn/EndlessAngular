# Endless

Welcome to my Project!
Everything was developed using the vanilla angular cli and good old HTML, CSS, and Typescript.

The webpage is hosted at https://endless-singlestone.netlify.app/

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c1151d4c-a4e2-4a91-968a-d2183692fd23/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/endless-singlestone/deploys)

Everything on the page is responsive with breakpoints at 1300px width, and 800px width for compatability.
In styles.css I included css for a stealth scroll bar for a clean ui.
As a showcase of accessibility I also included a media query that removes any transitions or animations and is used to detect if the user has requested that the system minimize the amount of non-essential motion it uses

Other possible accessibility features could be a theme toggle for colorblind users.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

Run `npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
