# Endless

Welcome to my Project!
Everything was developed using the vanilla angular cli and good old HTML, CSS, and Typescript.

Everything on the page is responsive with breakpoints at 1300px width, and 800px width for compatability.
In styles.css I included css for a stealth scroll bar for a clean ui.
As a showcase of accessibility I also included a media query that removes any transitions or animations and is used to detect if the user has requested that the system minimize the amount of non-essential motion it uses

Other possible accessibility features could be a theme toggle for colorblind users.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
